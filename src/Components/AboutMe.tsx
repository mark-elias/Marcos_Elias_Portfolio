      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hello, my name is Marcos Elias and I recently graduated from San Diego
        State with a Bachelors in Computer Science. I like to both watch and
        play sports and I like to play the guitar.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, I am enrolled in Kreativstorm's Hands-On Training Program,
        where I receive guidance from an industry professional to explore the
        latest industry trends, technologies, and best practices.
        Simultaneously, I'm honing essential soft skills such as communication,
        leadership, and teamwork.
      </p>
      <p>
        My current focus involves completing courses on React and NodeJS through
        codewithmosh.com and fireship.io. I have completed the HTML, CSS, and
        JavaScript courses and have also completed CodePath's Intro to Web
        Development course. This commitment aims to further improve my skills
        and proficiency in these areas.
      </p>
      <p>
        My passion lies in Front-End Web Development, and I am seeking an
        entry-level position to gain hands-on experience and refine my
        expertise.
