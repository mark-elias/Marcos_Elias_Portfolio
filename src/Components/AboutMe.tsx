      <p className="mb-3">
        Hello, my name is Marcos and I am a Computer Science grad from SDSU 🎓.
        My hobbies include watching sports 🏈, going to concerts 🎶, and playing
        the guitar 🎸.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-3">
        Proficient in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I applied my knowledge in
        CodePath’s Web Development course and Kreativstorm’s Front-End Training
        Program. These experiences honed my skills and instilled best practices,
        teamwork, and responsive web design techniques.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-3">
        Additionally, I have a solid understanding of React, Tailwind CSS,
        Typescript, and Git. I also have experience with NodeJS, ExpressJS, and
        MongoDB. I am currently working on a MERN stack project and hope to
        complete it soon.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-3">
        With a strong foundation in Front-End Web Development, I am eager to
        apply my knowledge to real-world challenges. My adaptability and
        determination make me well-suited for a fast-paced environment.
