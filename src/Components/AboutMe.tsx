      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hello, my name is Marcos and I am a Computer Science grad from SDSU. My
        hobbies include watching sports, going to concerts, and playing the
        guitar.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have completed training programs with CodePath and Kreativstorm where
        I received guidance from industry professionals to explore the latest
        industry trends, technologies, and best practices. I collaborated with
        trainees from other colleges and countries to improve my communication,
        leadership, and teamwork skills.
      </p>
      <p>
        My passion lies in Front-End Web Development, and I am seeking an
        entry-level position to gain hands-on experience and refine my
        expertise.
